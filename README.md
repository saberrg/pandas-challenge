Trends in School Performance by school type, size, budget and etc. 

Analysis done using pandas and jupyter notebook

Summary: 

In this notebook, you see an analysis done on school performance based on a variety of metrics (i.e. math and reading scores, spending per student capita, school budget, etc). The dataset used for this analysis is the merger of two provided sources: 'schools_complete.csv' , 'students_complete.csv'. The merged dataset was named 'school_data_complete'

Analyses: 

School Type and Performance: The analysis revealed that school type is an influential factor in determining student performance. Charter schools generally outperformed district schools in terms of average test scores and passing rates (See Scores by School Type Section). This suggests that the type of school management and educational approach of Charter Schools may lead to a greater academic achievement.

Spending Per Student and Performance: In Scores by School Spending, we are able to discover something quite fasincating... The scores of students who received more funding has been lower than students who received less funding. This discovery highlights may highlight the importance of having a proven resource allocation and utilization system (a.k.a being resourceful) is more likely to provide the desired results (i.e. improved grades) than just spending more money.
